A Delphi Pascal Windows Program that calculates and displays all possible solutions of the 8 Queens Problem

> ***This project is archived and is no longer being developed. No support is available. Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are not being accepted.***

For more information about the program please see the [8 Queens page](https://delphidabbler.com/software/queens) on [delphidabbler.com](https://delphidabbler.com).

A user guide is available in open document and PDF formats in this repo's `Docs` directory. The user guide is also included in the final release.

## Final release

The final release of the program is [v4.1.1](https://github.com/ddab-archive/8queens/releases/tag/v4.1.1-FINAL).

## Source Code

The source code was not originally developed under version control. Eventually the source code was moved to a Subversion repository. A summary of changes made before moving to version control can be found in [`Docs/PreSVNHistory.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddab-archive/8queens/main/Docs/PreSVNHistory.txt). The remainder of the history was recorded in the Subversion repo, a dump of which has been uploaded to `SVN/8queens-svndump.zip` [[download](https://github.com/ddab-archive/8queens/raw/main/SVN/8queens-svndump.zip)].

### Commits since the last release

The `main` branch of this project differs from the final release in two ways.

1. The original `README.md` file has been renamed `README-original.md` so that this file will be displayed on GitHub.
2. `8queens-svndump.zip` was uploaded to the `SVN` directory, as noted above.

The original `README.md` is the one that is included with the final release. It is also included in the source code zip file for that release.

The source code as it was at the final release can be viewed on GitHub by switching to the [`v4.1.1-FINAL`](https://github.com/ddab-archive/8queens/tree/v4.1.1-FINAL) tag.
