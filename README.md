=========================

What is 8 Queens?
-----------------

DelphiDabbler 8 Queens calculates and displays all possible solutions of the "eight queens problem". This problem asks how many different ways eight queens can be placed on a chess board so that no queen can take any other.

Installation
------------

8 Queens requires Windows 2000 or later to run.

You must have administrative privileges to install it. Elevation is required to install on Windows Vista and later.

8 Queens is provided in a zip file that contains a setup program,
`Queens-Setup-4.1.1.exe`. The zip file also contains this read-me file.

If you have an existing version of 8 Queens running you must stop it before proceeding.

> If you have 8 Queens v4.0 or earlier you should uninstall it now. Since these earlier versions of the program have no setup program, you must uninstall manually. Simply find the program and delete it along with its support files. If you installed the program in its own folder you can also delete the folder.

Extract the setup program from the zip file and run it, following the on-screen instructions. Once past the welcome page you will have to accept the license before proceeding further (see below). Once this is done you can configure the installation and then run the program.

When the installation completes you will have the chance to run the program.

The installer makes the following changes to your system:

* The main program's executable file and documentation are installed into the chosen install folder. By default this is `%ProgramFiles%\DelphiDabbler\8Queens` on 32 bit Windows or `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\DelphiDabbler\8Queens` on 64 bit Windows. The installed files include:

    * `Queens.exe` -- the program file.
    * `UserGuide.pdf` -- contains information about using the program.
    * `README.md` -- this file.
    * `LICENSE` -- the program's End User License Agreement.

* Files required by the uninstaller are stored in the main installation's `Uninst` sub-folder.

* The program's uninstall information is registered with the *Programs and Features* control panel applet (a.k.a *Add / Remove Programs*).

* A program group may be created in the start menu (optional).

Uninstallation
--------------

Open the *Programs and Features* (or *Add / Remove Programs*) control panel applet, navigate to the *DelphiDabbler 8 Queens* entry and click the *Remove* button. You will be asked to confirm removal of the program. Click *Yes* to proceed.
