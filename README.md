For more information about the program please see the [8 Queens page](https://delphidabbler.com/software/queens) on [delphidabbler.com](https://delphidabbler.com).

A user guide is available in open document and PDF formats in this repo's `Docs` directory. The user guide is also included in the final release.

## Final release

The final release of the program is [v4.1.1](https://github.com/ddab-archive/8queens/releases/tag/v4.1.1-FINAL).

### Changes from the last release

The `main` branch of this project differs from the final release in one way. The original `README.md` file has been renamed `README-original.md` to make way for this file.

The original `README.md` is the one that is included with release. It is also included in the final source code.

To see the state of the repo as originally archived, switch to the [`v4.1.1-FINAL`](https://github.com/ddab-archive/8queens/tree/v4.1.1-FINAL) tag.
